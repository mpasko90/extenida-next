They gave open and honest ideas, talked everything through with us to ensure we were happy. The products they recommended were 1st class. Their work is outstanding. I would highly recommend Extendia. We are thrilled with our new bathroom. And will definitely reach out when we can for them to do our kitchen too. Thank you Patryk, Micheal & team!",

    content: "A shower room in my apartment required complete refurbishment following a leak in the underfloor heating pipes. Extendia was one of the firms that came up on my search and I asked them amongst others to come and have a look at the job. From the start, I was impressed by Patryk's serious but pleasant and considerate manner. He was very quick to reply and his communication skills are admirable. The last thing I wanted was a person in charge who does not reply to phone calls, messages or emails. Patryk was anything but that. The quote was not necessarily the cheapest amongst others but extendia was may favorite firm. I am very pleased to say that My husband and I are not disappointed. The team were very professional from the time the contract was signed until the end. They completed an excellent job and have been ready to bend backwards to accommodate our needs including things that cropped up during the process. Patryk assured us on more than one occasion that everything will be done to our satisfaction. They started and completed the job as per promised timeline. Throughout the process, Patryk managed the project and visited the site frequently. My husband and I will not hesitate to call on their help whenever we need work done in the future. I hope they continue with this professional attitude as the firm grows.",
